				<h2>User Problem</h2>
				<h4 style="margin-top:5%; margin-bottom:10%">We are addressing the issue of a network failure in the case of natural disasters. 
				During these disasters existing communication networks are often among the first pieces of critical infrastructure to fail, 
				leaving individuals disconnected. In these events, wireless fidelity (Wi-Fi) networks and other forms of communication are obsolete; 
				making it difficult for rescue teams and those affected to communicate. This absence of communication increases the mortality rate, 
				of which we would like to limit. The solution shall be explained later in the description.</h4>

				<h2>Benefitting Group</h2>
				<h4 style="margin-top:5%; margin-bottom:10%">Disaster victims could rely on this network to access basic resources like maps and 
				local messaging in order to find someone near for help or gather as a team to save themselves. In addition, local authorities 
				could also use the network system to perform search and rescue operations by seeing what devices are connected to the Off-the grid network, 
				reducing the time it takes for rescue teams to find victims by searching their locations through the network, which could result in saving 
				more lives in the aftermath of a disaster.</h4>

				<h2>What Makes Us Different</h2>
				<h4 style="margin-top:5%; margin-bottom:10%">Our product is a low-cost kit based on a permanent Wi-Fi Long Distance (WiLD) testbed  
				previously designed and made by Professor Alan Mickelson and team, located at the University of Colorado at Boulder. We miniaturized 
				the technology in order to differentiate the product from others that already exist. This will enable the device to be portable and 
				quick to deploy in a disaster area. G.W.N will be able to communicate with other kits of its kind in order to build a stronger mesh 
				network and improve coverage as well as throughput. Additionally, G.W.N will locate the userâ€™s device in the network, in order to track 
				and rescue them in the event that they are trapped under a collapsed structure or in another perilous situation. Even during the earthquake 
				or flooding, the network can connect community members and responders, which will make the search and rescue mission more efficient. 
				With the improved network coverage created by the device users can access their needed information and other services via the Off-the-Grid 
				wireless network.</h4>
